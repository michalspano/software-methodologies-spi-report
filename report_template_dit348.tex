\section{Introduction}

% The introduction section should be used to introduce Software Processes and
% Software Process Improvement (SPI) in general and to introduce the purpose
% and context of this report.

A software process is a goal-oriented approach which incorporates a set of
tools, methods, and practices to produce a software product or a more general
software service \cite{Munch2012}, \cite{Humphrey1989}.
With the increasing complexity of software systems, the need for a well-defined
software process has become more and more significant.
With that in mind, Basili and Rombach \cite{Basili1988} state that the software
engineering processes require \textbf{tailorability} because of the diversity
of the software products and the different environments in which they are
developed, hence the need for a software process improvement (hereafter SPI)
initiative.

This paper analyzes a designed software process and proposes an SPI initiative 
in the context of the Lego Scrum workshop that took place during the course.
Ultimately, ... % <TODO> (one sentence; a discussion topic or something like that). 

\section{Process Defined for the Scrum Workshop}
\label{sec:process}

% Describe the process you defined for the Scrum Lego Workshop. Explain whether
% you chose to apply Scrum, User Story Practice, and Incremental Delivery. Give
% reasons for why you did or did not use elements from these three practices.

The defined process is titled {\fontfamily{qhv}\selectfont AKAMMO} and primarily
utilizes concepts from Scrum and Incremental Delivery, and to a lesser extent,
User Story Practice \cite{DIT348A1}. Scrum provides a flexible and adaptive
approach to project management, and encourages transparency in terms of the
project's progress and the issues encountered \cite{Schwaber2020}. Scrum, by
definition, is meant to be applied in an iterative manner, which is why a
conjunction with Incremental Delivery becomes a natural choice
\cite{Schwaber2020}, \cite{Srivastava2017}, \cite{Schwaber1997}.

Initially, the process assumes a set of user stories that are to be implemented
(and are prioritized by the Product Owner, hereafter PO). Afterwards, the team
members analyze the user stories and decide whether they require a further
elicitation of requirements (which is discussed with the PO) or whether they
can be implemented as they are.
Moreover, before each sprint, \textbf{sprint planning} takes place. It is an
activity that aims to split up the user stories into more granular requirements
that, once implemented, satisfy the acceptance criteria of a particular user
story, and, additionally, sprint planning is thought of as a way to delegate
requirements to the members of the team.

Subsequently, the requirements are assigned \textbf{story points} that
correspond to the difficulty of their implementation (i.e., the higher
the number, the more difficult the implementation) based on the Fibonacci
sequence. Strikingly, Tamrakar and JÃ¸rgensen \cite{Tamrakar2012} observe that
the Fibonacci scale (among other non-linear scales) eliminates the bias that is
introduced by any linear scale such that humans tend to be biased towards the
middle of the scale, and thereby non-linear scales yield more accurate results.

Furthermore, a \textbf{Kanban board} is to be used throughout the workshop to
categorize each user story into one of the following columns: (i) \textit{To
Do}, (ii) \textit{In Progress}, (iii) \textit{Done}. The reason why a Kanban
board was considered can be supported by a claim made by Ahmad et al.
\cite{Ahmad2014} suggesting that a Kanban board provides visibility to the
[software] development process, communicates priorities and highlights
bottlenecks. The process does not assume any type of a board; either a physical
or a digital board can be used.

What's more, a sprint is to last an hour and at the end of each sprint, a
meeting takes place which is, put simply, a conjunction of a sprint review and
a sprint retrospective (adapted from Scrum \cite{Schwaber2020}). Herein, the
team members are to discuss the difficulties they encountered as well as
evaluate the overall progress made. Consequently, this meeting results in a
definition of an \textbf{increment} to the product that is to be delivered to
the PO.

The process, by default, does not schedule any breaks; however, there is a
possibility of a so-called \textit{emergency break} that can be called by any
team member at most once every 30 minutes on a team-wide basis.
Breaks on an individual basis are allowed, but shall not interfere with the
team's progress. In a typical Scrum environment, stand-up meetings are held
continuously throughout a set period of time \cite{Schwaber2020}. However, in
the context of the Lego Scrum workshop, the team members are not obliged to
hold such meetings, since the team merely consists of six members, and the
workshop itself is not meant to last longer than four hours.

% TODO: can add more text here if the page limit permits.

\section{Experiences in the Scrum Workshop}
\label{sec:experiences}

% In this section, you should describe your experiences during the first Scrum
% Lego workshop. Put a special focus on how you and your group were using the
% process, which parts of the process worked well, and which parts of the
% process did not work well. For the latter part, analyze the reasons that
% caused problems. Use at least three references to the literature (e.g.,
% \cite{CaterSteel2006}, \cite{Abrahamsson2002}) to identify if the issues you
% encountered are general problems or specific to your effort.

On the whole, the aforementioned process, {\fontfamily{qhv}\selectfont AKAMMO},
seemed to be a viable choice for the first Lego Scrum Workshop. The team members
considered the process to be flexible enough to accommodate the needs of the
team, and, at the same time, it was not too rigid to hinder the team's progress
\cite{DIT348A2}.

The process has been followed in the manner described in the previous section
(Section~\ref{sec:process}) with little to no deviations. Indeed, it was the
first time such a process was put to use, and, as a result, the team members
were able to evaluate the possible shortcomings of the process and, in turn,
suggest improvements, as well as highlight the parts of the process that worked
up to the expectations. The following subsections discuss the observations made
by the team members.

First and foremost, the team members have felt that initiating a sprint with a 
\textbf{sprint planning} enabled them to have a clear understanding of the requirements
that were to be worked on. Secondly, it was observed that merging the sprint
review and retrospective into a \textbf{single meeting} was a logical choice. In most
cases, such a meeting merely consisted of a brief discussions of the difficulties
encountered by the team members with a subsequent overview of the progress made.
So, it was deemed unnecessary to have two separate meetings for particular a sprint.
Additionally, omitting the stand-up meetings was likewise seen as a reasonable
decision because: (i) the team consisted of only six members, (ii) the workshop
was not meant to last longer than four hours, and (iii) the team members were
able to communicate with each other without any issues throughout the workshop
(all team members were located in the same room). Interestingly, this approach
(mainly supported by the last two points) proved to be so effective that no
\textit{"emergency breaks"} were called by any of the team members.

Nonetheless, there have been several concerns that were raised by the team
members, and these are discussed in the following subsections with some
relevant references to the suggested literature. Firstly, a lack of a sensible
\textbf{Definition of Done} (abbreviated as DoD) was observed. Put simply, a
DoD is a set of criteria points applied iteratively to each granular increment
of a product to attest that the increment is of a desired quality
\cite{Kopczynska2022} when considered to be \textit{done}. The DoD principle is
a crucial component of the product's quality assurance, and, as Abrahamsson and
Kautz \cite{Abrahamsson2002} point out, quality assurance incorporates an
ability to identify defects as early as possible---this becomes viably
achievable with a well-defined DoD.

In turn, not having a DoD in place might result in a product that is of
undesirable quality or a product that elevated the costs of its development.
Moreover, the lack of a DoD might cause misunderstandings between the team
members and the PO which distresses the overall progress of the project. These
claims are supported by a study conducted by Kopczynska et al.
\cite{Kopczynska2022}.

Furthermore, during the second and third sprints, the team members \textbf{omitted
assigning story points} to the user stories. This arose from the fact that the
team members were so emerged in working on the individual user stories that
they did not feel the need to assign story points to them. Undeniably, this
might lead to a serious threat in a real-word project. As Abrahamsson and Kautz
\cite{Abrahamsson2002} observe, it is a recurring issue that teams conduct improper
estimations---in our case, the estimations were not made at all. If a certain
risk (of any rather serious nature) were to occur, the lack of estimations
would make it difficult (and in some cases impossible) to assess the impact of
the risk on the project's progress.

Lastly, it has been observed that the process did not entail any \textbf{cross-team
communication efforts}. However, the nature of the Lego Scrum workshop was to
produce a city environment with a set of buildings, where each team was
responsible for one (or more) buildings. It is, in this case, unavoidable that
the buildings are interconnected in some way, and, as a result, the teams were
required to communicate with each other. This fact was not taken
into account when designing the process, and proved to be a bottleneck for the
team's progress. This is, in fact, not an issue specific to our endeavor,
albeit a rather general problem. Larsson and Larsson \cite{Larsson2020}
postulate that conducting cross-team collaborative approaches to lessen
integration risks is unavoidable, and should not be disregarded in a
high-quality process. Cater-Steel et al. \cite{CaterSteel2006} further
emphasize the importance of cross-team communication by stating, quote,
\textit{"[...] high quality external expertise is [even] more critical than top
management support"}. Ultimately, a study conducted by Niazi et al. concludes
that the lack of communication is one of the common SPI barriers that are
encountered in practice \cite{Niazi2010}.
It is thereby evident that the lack of cross-team communication poses a serious
threat that should be addressed in the future stages of the maturity of the
process.

\section{Software Process Improvement Techniques}
\label{sec:spi-techniques}

% Provide at least three examples of SPI methods/models/techniques (for an
% overview, see, e.g., \cite{Pettersson2008}). Describe each of them together
% with at least one advantage and one disadvantage.

In our ever-emerging world of software engineering, there is a plethora of SPI
methods, models, and techniques that are available to the practitioners.
Examples of some common SPI models include the Capability Maturity Model
Integration (CMMI), the ISO/IEC 15504 standard, or a more lightweight approach,
the iFLAP model \cite{Pettersson2008}, to name a few. In the following
section, I will briefly describe some of the techniques that are introduced by
iFLAP in relation to the process that was designed for the Lego Scrum workshop.
CMMI and ISO/IEC 15504 are not discussed in this section, since our process is
merely applicable for a small-scale project (with a defined time frame of not
more than four hours), therefore, the aforementioned models may not be suitable
for our endeavor.

\textbf{{\fontfamily{qhv}\selectfont iFLAP}} is an inductive process assessment
framework that largely incorporates the involvement of the practitioners in the
assessment process \cite{Pettersson2008}, \cite{Malvius2009}. Its core
principles are to: (i) construct a feasible selection of roles (and projects),
(ii) gather data points, document them and triangulate the improvement issues,
and (iii) construct an improvement plan based on the analyzed data, identify
dependencies among the improvement issues, and prioritize them; these key
principles [of iFLAP] are adapted from the summary provided by Pettersson et
al. \cite{Pettersson2008}.

A central part of iFLAP is the selection of \textbf{roles} that are to be
involved in the assessment process. This way, once the analysis of the gathered
data is completed, the findings represent viewpoints of a broader spectrum
which is beyond the team's level. Having applied such a technique to our
process, we would, for instance, be able to obtain insights from the PO(s),
team members, the instructor(s), other teams, scrum masters, and so forth. This
would allow us to identify the shortcomings of the process from the perspective
of different actors. As a result, the concern that was discussed, for instance,
in Section~\ref{sec:experiences} about the lack of cross-team communication
would inherently diminish, since the technique induces a need to communicate on
a wider scale. While the technique appears rather straightforward, it does
present several concerns. The role selection is a time-consuming process and,
consequently, might hinder the progress of the project. Additionally, biases
may influence the role selection, and thus the assessment findings may provide
inaccurate and unreliable outcomes.

Furthermore, iFLAP suggests to \textbf{gather data} from the selected roles
with the help of interviews and questionnaires. This would allow us to obtain
a more detailed overview of the issues that were encountered during the collective
effort. However, similar to the previous technique, the primary limitation of
this technique is the time that is required to gather the data. Interviews, on
a general note, do provide valuable insights into the issues at hand, albeit
they tend to be lengthy and time-consuming. Questionnaires, on the other hand,
are relatively easy and quick to conduct, but they do not provide as much
detail as interviews do. On the contrary, an analysis of a questionnaire
becomes feasible with the help of automated tools or scripts that can be
written by any general-purpose programming language (e.g., Python, Julia,
etc.). Nevertheless, having applied this technique to our process, we could
leverage the gathered data to enhance the process in the future stages of its
maturity. For instance, we could identify a new strategy on how a DoD is to be
modeled, or, perhaps, we could identify a new technique to estimate the user
stories.

Ultimately, iFLAP further recommends to identify \textbf{dependencies between
improvement issues} as well as \textit{"package"} the improvement issues into
improvement areas \cite{Pettersson2008}, \cite{Malvius2009}. For instance, the
lack of a DoD is an improvement issue and corresponds to an improvement area of
\textit{quality assurance}. The identification of such dependencies allows the
team to tackle the issues in a more efficient manner. That is, if a certain
dependency is found, then a successful resolution of one issue might result in
a successful resolution of another issue, or, at least, provide an indication
of how to resolve the latter issue. This technique, under general
circumstances, is not too demanding to realize. However, an extensive domain
knowledge is required to be able to draw dependencies between the improvement
issues, and, in a larger-scale project, this becomes resource-intensive
\cite{Pettersson2008}. Though, in our case, the technique is relevant and
feasible to implement---it must be, however, assumed that the team members have
a sufficient understanding of the domain, so that dependencies can be drawn
between the improvement issues in a sensible manner.

% Relate each of those methods/models/techniques to the problems you
% encountered and described in Section~\ref{sec:experiences}.
% Explain whether they are applicable to your issues and why.

\section{SPI Proposal for future Scrum Development Efforts}
\label{sec:proposal}

% In this section, you should discuss and explain the concrete SPI steps that
% you suggest to take in order to improve the process you applied during the
% first Scrum Lego Workshop. First, define at least three goals for an SPI
% proposal based on what you wrote in Section~\ref{sec:experiences}. Second,
% define questions and metrics you connect to those goals.

In this section, the {\fontfamily{qhv}\selectfont GQM} tool is utilized as part
of the SPI proposal, and is adapted from the assignments of the course that
the team worked on, notably \cite{DIT348A3}, \cite{DIT348A4}. Basili, Caldiera,
and Rombach \cite{Caldiera1994} define CQM as an approach which underscores the
importance of organizations defining their \textbf{goals}, linking them to
operational data, and establishing a framework for data interpretation in order
to \textbf{measure purposefully} their progress towards the goals. It was
originally defined to evaluate defects in a set of NASA projects
\cite{Caldiera1994}, though, over the years, it has been tailored to be
applicable to a broader spectrum of projects.

Before proceeding with the SPI, let us define some notation. A goal is written
as \textit{x}). A question follows the notion Q\textit{x.y} Similarly, a metric
follows the notion M\textit{x.z}. A metric, in our context, provides a
measurement plan with a general idea of how the data is to be collected and
analyzed. In some cases, there's an example provided for the ease of
understanding.

Based on the observations made in Section~\ref{sec:experiences}, the following
goals are defined for the SPI proposal:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Improve the clarity and consistency of task completion from the
    development teamâs viewpoint.
  \item Enhance the estimation and planning with the help of story points
    from the viewpoint of the development team. 
  \item Strengthen cross-team communication and integration with a
    designated role from the development team. 
\end{enumerate}

With that in mind, 1) is accompanied with the following questions and metrics:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Q1.1}: What is the team members' understanding the DoD?
  \item \textbf{M1.1}: Number of items in the DoD that team members share a
    common understanding of. The data would be obtained from the team members
    in a designated questionnaire -- each team member would be asked to define,
    in own words, what the items of the DoD are. Then, with the help of a
    machine learning algorithm that is able to parse human language (e.g., a
    recurrent neural network), the responses would be clustered into a set of
    groups where each group represents an overlap of the responses. The number
    of groups would correspond to the metric. In case such an algorithm is not
    available, the responses can be manually clustered into groups. The
    information would be stored on a local machine of one of the team members
    and would not be shared with any third parties. Ultimatelt, the obtained
    value should be as close to the total number of items in the DoD as
    possible.
  \item \textbf{Q1.2}: How consistently is the Definition of Done applied to
    carrying work related to user stories among the team?
  \item \textbf{M1.2}: A formulate in the following manner is to be used:
    $\frac{n_d}{n} \times 100$ (\%), where $n_d$ is the number of tasks that
    followed the DoD principles when delivered to the PO, and $n$ is the number
    of all tasks expected to be worked on within a set time frame (such as a
    sprint). In the context of the Lego Scrum workshop, it is difficult to keep
    track of how many times the DoD was applied, since the team members may
    report inaccurate data. However, in the context of a real-world software
    project, this metric can be easily obtained by observing whether the DoD
    was appended to a, say, merge request (or a pull request) that was merged into
    the \textit{main} branch of the project's repository. Nevertheless, for our case, we
    assume that the team members are honest and report accurate data.
    Subsequently, the aforementioned formula is applied and team members are
    made aware of the results. The calculations are to be stored (and
    performed) on a local machine of one of the team members. Supposing that
    each sprint is evaluted separately, the obtained values can be compared and
    an increase or decrease in the metric can be observed. Ideally, each sprint
    should yield a value of $\approx 100$. Team members are encouraged to set
    an acceptable threshold interval for the metric, say $[90, 100]$, and
    strive to achieve a value within the interval. This interval can fluctuate
    depending on the team's needs.
\end{itemize}

Secondly, 2) is accompanied with the following questions and metrics:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Q2.1}: How accurately do the assigned user story points align
    with the actual time invested?
  \item \textbf{M2.1}:
    Decide how many minutes one story point represents (this is to be decided
    at the beginning of a sprint by all team members). For this example, let's
    say that one story point represents 5 minutes. Then, once the sprint has
    elapsed, a randomly chosen team member collects the total number of story
    points completed during the sprint, say $s$, and afterwards collects the
    total time that the team members have spent working on the user stories [in
    minutes], say $t$. The team members would be previously instructed on how
    to track time spent working during a sprint with the help of an appropriate
    tool such as \textit{Toggl} (or any other tool that is deemed suitable).
    The chosen team member would then perform a simple calculation on their
    local machine in the following way: $\frac{s}{t}$. In this case, the ideal
    ratio is $\approx \frac{1}{5}$. A threshold interval can be defined as
    $[\frac{1}{5} - \epsilon, \frac{1}{5} + \epsilon]$, where $\epsilon$ is
    some small number, say $0.1$. If the ratio falls within the threshold
    interval, then the story points are considered to be an accurate
    representation of the time invested. The ratio can be altered to fit the
    team's needs, and [the ratio] can be derived from the team's experience in
    the previous sprints and/or projects. The results, for a future reference,
    can be stored in a communication channel (such Slack, Discord, and so
    forth).
  \item \textbf{Q2.2}: How can story points enhance the workload distribution
    among team members?
  \item \textbf{M2.2}: 
    Establish how many story points a team member is expected to complete
    during a sprint (this value is decided by the team members at the beginning
    of a sprint), namely $m$. Assume that team members should work on an equal
    basis, i.e., they should complete the same number of story points in a
    given time frame (in our case, a sprint). Keep track of the number of story
    points that each team member completes during a sprint, and, once the
    sprint is over, assign them to variables $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$, where $n$
    is the size of the team. Furthermore, it is the responsibility of each team
    member to keep track of their own story points---how they do it is up to
    them. At the end of the sprint, a randomly chosen team member collects all
    data entries and performs a calculation on their local machine in the
    following manner: $\beta = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - m|$. Herein, $\beta$ is an
    arbitrary value that represents the workload distribution among the team
    members. The closer $\beta$ is to $0$, the more evenly distributed the
    workload is. In that essence, similarly to the previous metric, a threshold
    interval can be defined, and an appropriate $\epsilon$ can be chosen (this
    is to be determined by the team members based on their experience and
    intuition).
\end{itemize}

Lastly, 3) is accompanied with the following questions and metrics:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Q3.1}: How effective are the cross-team communication efforts?
  \item \textbf{M3.1}: An averaged satisfaction score that is obtained from the
    team members and all other parties involved in any cross-team meetings. A
    traditional Likert scale from $1 \to 5$ can be used to obtain the score,
    where $1$ corresponds to \textit{"Strongly dissatisfied"} and $5$
    corresponds to \textit{"Strongly satisfied"}. Ideally, the team should
    strive to obtain a score of $\approx 5$. A team member who has volunteered
    (or has been randomly selected, if no one volunteers) will be responsible
    to notify all people involved in the meeting about the survey (typically,
    once the meeting has ended) and provide them with the appropriate link. The
    survey itself shall not take more than 1 minute so that the participants do
    fill it in. The survey can be constructed with the help of, for instance,
    Google Forms, and the results can be stored in a Google Sheets document.
    Therein, the team members can observe the results which are updated in
    real-time and calculated automatically, and, if necessary, take appropriate
    actions. The sheet can be re-used for future meetings too.
  \item \textbf{Q3.2}: How well do contributions from all teams function together?
  \item \textbf{M3.2}: The number of integration problems occurring during the
    project (or during a sprint, if a more granular approach is desired) is to
    be counted. The data is to be obtained from the team members and the PO(s)
    by a volunteer (or a randomly selected team member, if no one volunteers from
    the team). The data is to be stored in a Google Sheets document or a simple
    Markdown/text file (which is distributed to all team members). The data
    is updated continuously, meaning that, if required, the team members can
    take appropriate actions in a timely manner.
\end{itemize}

In terms of 1), items in the DoD are to be continuously reviewed and updated
based on the team's needs. Observations from the matrics M1.1 and M1.2 are to
act as a guideline for the team members to identify the shortcomings of the
DoD. For instance, if the team members are not able to unable to grasp the
items of the DoD, then they are to be rephrased in a more understandable
manner. On the other hand, if the team members consistently fail to apply the
DoD to their work, then, perhaps some of the items of the current DoD may be
cumbersome to follow, and, as a result, the DoD is subject to be revised.
Additionally, The Kanban board would be extended with a new column titled
\textit{QA} (which stands for \textit{Quality Assurance}). The column would
hold user stories that are subject to be reviewed based on the principles of
the team's DoD. Afterwards, if all items of the DoD are satisfied, the user
story is moved to the \textit{Done} column. Otherwise, the user story is moved
back to the \textit{To Do} column. So, the updated flow would be as follows:
$\textit{To Do} \to \textit{In Progress} \leftrightarrow \textit{QA} \to
\textit{Done}$.

% TODO: revisit if these are actually feasible.

Regarding 2), using the metric of 2.1, team members obtain a clear indication
of how accurate their estimations are. As a result, they would be encouraged to
investigate the reasons behind the deviations from the ideal ratio, and, in
turn, practice their estimation capabilities. Doing so would not only enhance
the team's overall performance, but also, inherently, mature the process.
What's more, the metric 2.2 would help to uncover any workload discrepancies
among the team. Concretely, the two extrema (i.e., the minimum and the maximum)
would be taken from the set of values $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$, and the team
members would be encouraged to discuss the reasons behind the discrepancies.
For the upcoming sprint, the team member who underperformed would be assigned a
smaller number of story points, and, vice versa, the team member who
overperformed would be assigned a larger number of story points (the alteration
of the number of story points is to be decided by the team members, though, in
case of a disagreement, $20\%$ of the number of story points is to be added or
subtracted).

To address 3), firstly, we intend to propose that all teams schedule several
meetings throughout the workshop (e.g., once an hour) to discuss any
integration problems that might arise or have been encountered. Secondly, we
would have a designated role whose responsibility is to oversee any integration
concerns and communicate with the other teams. The role would be assigned in a
round-robin fashion (this way, each team member would have a chance to take on
the role). Moreover, the person given this role would be leading the meetings
[discussed in previous improvement step] and would utilize the metrics and
measurement plans, notably M3.1 and M3.2.

\section{Implementation of an SPI Initiative}
\label{sec:implementation}

Beacause of an illness, I was unable to attend the second Lego Scrum workshop,
so the alternative task is to be completed instead in this section instead.

TODO: finish this section. Use the paper \cite{Niazi2010} as a reference.
Use the extra assignment as a reference too.

% If you did not attend the Lego workshops, this section may be dedicated to a
% discussion of challenges in SPI projects. Find at least four relevant
% references that mention and analyze challenges and compile an overview of
% what has been observed in the literature.

% Relate these challenges to empirical studies that have been published and to
% your personal experience.

% Identify the SPI techniques that might help to overcome these challenges.
% Critically discuss the solution approaches from the papers.

\section{Redesign of the Software Process}
\label{sec:redesign}

An updated version of the diagram can be seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:process-diagram}. In this section, some key aspects of the
diagram are described in more detail.

Most importantly, the task definition \textit{"Cross-team meeting"} has been
added. This change should address the SPI initiative in terms of enhancing
cross-team communication efforts and the detection of integration issues (see
the last paragraph of Section~\ref{sec:experiences} and 3) from
Section~\ref{sec:proposal}). Simultaneously, a new role titled
\textit{"Integration Lead"}, whose primary responsibility is represented with a
new task definition \textit{"Oversee integration defects"}, has been added. The
addition of this role is supposed to realize the second improvement step of 3)
(see Section~\ref{sec:proposal}). During these meetings, an
\textit{"Integration Issue Log"} is to be utilized which the Integration Lead
is responsible for. Furthermore, participation of the PO is encouraged, and the
other teams are invited to join the meetings too---they are depicted in a
\textit{cluster} of several role definitions titled \textit{"Other Teams"}.

The \fontfamily{qhv}\selectfont AKAMMO\rmfamily{} team members are represented
with a single role definition, and the Integration Lead is a member of the team. The
team, moreover, is supposed to maintain the DoD and the Kanban board (which are
work product definitions). The team also performs \textit{"Sprint Planning"} and
\textit{"Review \& Retrospective"} meetings (these remain unchanged and the
descriptions from Section~\ref{sec:process} are still applicable). Lastly,
following the principles of \textbf{incremental delivery}, the team, after each
sprint, delivers an increment that undergoes a few stages ultimately resulting
in an \textit{"evaluated increment"} which servers as a basis for the following
sprint.

\section{Bonus Task: Scrum of Scrums}
\label{sec:bonus_task}

This task needs to be solved to get a 5 (pass with distinction).
Note that to get a 5, all other tasks need to be at a level that fulfill the criteria for a 4.
The bonus task cannot be used to pass the exam if you would fail it based on the other tasks.
It cannot be used to improve a 3 (pass) either.

In the workshops, you observed many issues that related to inter-team coordination. One way to address those issues is to have more frequent Scrum of Scrum meetings. Another way to solve them is to have coordination artifacts that create a common understanding between different teams. Find at least three different peer-reviewed sources in the literature that discuss inter-team coordination and/or Scrum of Scrum meetings. Explain at least two challenges that have been reported connected to Scrum of Scrum meetings. Explain and justify whether you would recommend big companies to rely on frequent Scrum of Scrum meetings or whether you think other mechanisms are better for inter-team coordination. 

If you decide to submit the bonus task, you get 1/2 page for it. The new page limit will be 6.5 pages.

\section{Summary and Lessons Learned}
\label{sec:summary}
In the summary section, you should briefly summarize what your report is about and present your main findings/consequences.

This section must be worked on individually.
